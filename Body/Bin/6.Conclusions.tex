\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The hierarchical FDD framework effectively detects, classifies, and localizes faults in the IEEE 9-bus system.
    \item Integration of the Random Patches Ensemble Classifier ensures robustness and high accuracy across FRI, FTC, and FLP tasks.
    \item Results demonstrate:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Near-perfect accuracy in FRI and FTC.
      \item Strong performance in FLP with resilience to noise.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Synthetic dataset generation captures diverse fault scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} Extend the methodology to larger systems such as IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems.
    \item \textbf{Validation:} Evaluate the framework using real-world datasets to assess practical applicability.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Scenarios:} Incorporate dynamic and real-time scenarios using Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS).
    \item \textbf{Comparative Analysis:} Explore advanced ML models such as CNNs, LSTMs, and hybrid architectures for further improvements.
  \end{itemize}
